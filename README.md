These WSR-88D PBLH and EZ Estimation Algorithms have been used in the preparation of

Stouffer et al. (2025a): Evaluating Planetary Boundary Layer and Land 
Surface Models via Dual-Polarization WSR-88D and Flux Tower Observations.
Monthly Weather Review (https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-25-0032.1).

Stouffer et al. (2025b): Estimates of Entrainment Zone Depth Across the United States 
from Dual-Polarization WSR-88D Radar Observations.
Monthly Weather Review (in review).

If you use these algorithms in any published work, please cite the above
journal articles.

Using Anaconda, the necessary environment can be created using:
conda env create -f env.yml

For the algorithm to function properly, the QVPs should begin around 8AM
local time and end around 8PM local time.
