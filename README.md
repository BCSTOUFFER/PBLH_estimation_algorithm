These WSR-88D PBLH and EZ Estimation Algorithms have been used in the preparation of

Stouffer et al. (2025a): Evaluating Planetary Boundary Layer and Land 
Surface Models via Dual-Polarization WSR-88D and Flux Tower Observations.
Monthly Weather Review (https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-25-0032.1).

Stouffer et al. (2025b): Estimates of Entrainment Zone Depth Across the United States 
from Dual-Polarization WSR-88D Radar Observations.

If you use these algorithms in any published work, please cite the above
journal articles.

Using Anaconda, the necessary environment can be created using:
conda env create -f env.yml

For the algorithm to function properly, the QVPs should begin around 8AM
local time and end around 8PM local time.
